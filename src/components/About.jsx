        I&apos;m Joshua Dsouza, a passionate software engineer currently
        pursuing my Master&apos;s at Arizona State University. With a strong
        foundation in web and cloud technologies, I’ve had the opportunity to
        lead some exciting projects during my time as a Cloud Web Developer at
        Fourth Signal. From transforming monolithic architectures into sleek
        microservices to introducing fully automated CI/CD pipelines, I love
        making things run faster and more efficiently. On the side, I’ve also
        dabbled in mobile development and game design—because why not keep
        things fun, right? One of my proudest moments was building a 3D virtual
        campus tour, which even got me published in an IEEE conference! When I’m
        not coding or solving tech problems, you might find me mentoring,
        organizing events, or leading a team (like I did as President of the
        Information Technology Students’ Association). My journey so far has
        been a mix of creativity, problem-solving, and leadership—and I’m always
        looking forward to the next challenge!
